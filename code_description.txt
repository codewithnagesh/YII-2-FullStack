This code sample is a representation of my expertise, coding standards, and in-depth understanding of the Yii2 framework. I implemented this module as an efficient and user-friendly interface for managing translations on a multilingual website.


The module incorporates several advanced features aimed at streamlining the translation process:

- Auto-Detection of Language Elements: The system intelligently scans the website to identify elements requiring translation, eliminating manual effort and ensuring consistency across the site.
- Duplicate Translation Management: It includes a mechanism to detect and remove duplicate translations from the database, optimizing storage and ensuring accurate data.
- Seamless Translation Import: New translations can be imported into the database effortlessly, keeping the multilingual content up-to-date without manual intervention.
- Client-Side Translation: By leveraging Google Translate APIs, the module can perform translations directly on the client side, offering quick and temporary translations without altering the backend database.



Technologies used:

- Backend: YII-2.0
- Database: Mysql
- Frontend: JavaScript
- Integration: Google Translate API Integration (Allows to translate text on the client side)
